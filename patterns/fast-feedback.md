# Fast feedback

## Context

* These notes are part of a broader set of [principles](../principles.md)

## The pattern

Fast reliable feedback allows teams to move quickly with safety.

## Benefits

* Automated feedback is the most reliable kind, e.g. [code quality](everything-as-code.md), [builds](../practices/continuous-integration.md), unit and other [tests](../practices/testing.md).
* The earlier feedback is available, the quicker it is to address.
* Improved lead time: teams build confidence in making changes, allowing them to move faster and be bolder.
* Improved overall quality.
* Reduced delivery times.
