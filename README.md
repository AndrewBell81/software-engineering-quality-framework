# Software Engineering Quality Framework

The framework aims to:
* Describe a shared (across multiple teams) view of what "good" looks like
* Assist teams to practice continuous improvement
* Signpost useful training resources and examples/blueprints relating to aspects of "good"
* Provide resources useful for establishment & expansion of an engineering community

The framework is a companion, rather than an alternative, to the [NHS service standard](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard).

The framework consists of:
* [Engineering principles](principles.md)
* [Quality assessment tool](assessment.md)
* [Communities of practice guidelines](communities-of-practice.md) and active communities:
     * [Automation working group](communities/automation-working-group.md)
