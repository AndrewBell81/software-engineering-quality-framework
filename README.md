# Software Engineering Quality Framework

The framework aims to:
* Describe a shared (across multiple teams) view of what "good" looks like
* Assist teams to practice continuous improvement
* Signpost useful training resources and examples/blueprints relating to aspects of "good"
* Provide resources useful for establishment & expansion of an engineering community

The framework consists of:
* [Engineering principles](principles.md)
* [Quality assessment tool](assessment.md)
* [Communities of practice](communities-of-practice.md) guidelines
