# Communities of practice

This is part of a broader [quality framework](README.md)

A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who "share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly" ([Introduction to communities of practice](https://wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/)). This document gives guidance on forming and running a CoP.

# Scope

CoPs are formed around a single subject which should be neither so narrow as to give little value to members (e.g. unit testing), nor so broad that it is difficult to find topics within the subject which are of broad interest to the group (e.g. all of software engineering). We discuss scope more in [Format](#format), as the scope can have an implication for the most appropriate format. The subject should be of relevance to the goals of the organisation to attract investment (see [Time](#time)), e.g. testing would be an appropriate subject for an organisation which delivers software, basket weaving would not, public speaking may be.

# Goals

It is important to set goals when forming a CoP to avoid it losing purpose and direction. Goals should be valuable to individuals and the wider organisation.

Not all goals need to produce output in a material sense. Some focus more on harder to quantify results like individual learning. Having a balance of these is quite healthy and encouraged. If attendees start to see the CoP as just more actions to add to their to do list they could disengage.

Some common goals are listed below.  We use the term _practitioner_ for someone whose primary job or role aligns strongly with the CoP’s scope, _apprentice_ for those who view the subject as an outside interest, _other_ for everyone else in the organisation and _public_ for anyone outside the organisation.

* **Support** individual _practitioners_ with the specific challenges they are facing, usually with advanced or difficult topics.

* **Support** individual _apprentices_ with the challenges they are facing, often with more basic techniques.

* **Educate** by broadening and deepening _practitioners’_ and apprentices’ knowledge of the subject.

* **Educate** by helping _practitioners_ and _apprentices_ learn about new and emerging tools and techniques.

* **Educate** to help _others_ do their job better, typically for topics which are useful for all but not of sufficient interest to attend a CoP (e.g. writing user stories, load testing).

* **Evaluate** projects, teams or individuals using specific knowledge of the subject, e.g. to develop and refine the way that _practitioners_ are assessed for recruitment and progression, or teams maturity is assessed to understand where outside support may be needed.

* **Evangelise** to improve _public_ awareness of the organisation’s capabilities in this subject, usually to drive recruitment or customer acquisition by building credibility.

It may be beneficial to focus on one or two goals initially with the intention to take on other goals over time. A common challenge which CoPs encounter is maintaining focus to deliver useful outcomes with the limited time available (see [Time](#time)). The best way to avoid this is to set achievable goals rather than being overambitious.

# Format

CoPs are fuelled by interactions between individuals. Broadly, interactions are either "live" (either in person or remotely by video call) or asynchronous (recorded or written). Several interaction formats are common, and CoPs often use more than one of these:

* Live "round table" or lean coffee format discussion.

* Meeting with a specific purpose and agenda.

* Internal or public "clinic".

* Live or recorded training sessions.

* Live or recorded show and tell or presentation &mdash; for internal or public audience.

* Written show and tell or presentation (blog post style &mdash; internal or public).

* Shared written examples (e.g. of definitions of done or test strategies). Usually in a raw state and for internal use only.

* Written training material for internal or public use.

* Written policies or standards &mdash; for internal use, but could still be public.

Different formats are better suited to different goals, depending on:

* How repeatable the communication needs to be, e.g. providing bespoke support vs a set of interview questions.

* The interest level of the audience, from practitioner to public.

* The amount of information to be communicated, e.g. a lessons learned presentation vs a policy or standard.

Think carefully about which format or combination of formats will best suit the particular goal in mind.

# Leadership

Well-functioning CoPs do not come about by accident, and good leadership is essential to establish clear goals and the operating model. The aim is not to direct or control the CoP, but to provide the support and focus needed to create common purpose and expectations in the group and to evolve the goals and format over time.

Typically, CoPs which work well have a designated coordinator plus a core group. The coordinator can be a rotating post, e.g. with a different person being appointed every three months. The core group is simply the members who most actively and regularly participate and contribute.

# Time

CoPs provide valuable learning opportunities, which benefit individuals and the organisation. As such, it is often appropriate to run CoPs over lunch time or after work to avoid impacting the working day. Many CoPs will provide refreshments of some sort to recognise and encourage the personal commitment from participants &mdash; anything from biscuits to sandwiches or pizza are common.

However, experience has shown that CoPs are most effective when at least some "work" time is allocated also. This is especially necessary where preparation is necessary (e.g. for presentations), for those coordinating CoPs, or where the goal is more clearly to deliver benefit for the organisation than the individual (e.g. creating interview questions, assessment frameworks or policies and standards). And in areas where the organisation wishes to place particular focus (e.g. security) it may be appropriate to hold regular meet ups in work hours.

Time can be allocated using a combination of a per person budget and a per CoP budget:

* The **per person budget** provides rough guidance on an appropriate amount of "work" time for each individual to spend on CoP activity across all CoPs they participate in. It should be personalised and agreed with the individual’s manager or equivalent. The appropriate amount of time will naturally vary between individuals and will balance benefit to the individual and the organisation from participating in CoPs with the demands of the individual’s primary role. This is the main mechanism to regulate the cost of recurring sessions such as monthly meet ups.

* The **per CoP budget** is a monthly time allocation for the CoP to be distributed by the coordinator to members of the group and is on top of the per person budget. The amount of time should be appropriate to deliver the agreed goals but would typically be a few hours to a few days per month. This allocation could vary over time and would be higher for periods where there is particular focus on delivering goals which will take more time commitment.

# Sponsor

Any allocation of "work" time for CoP activity or cost associated with providing refreshments or materials (e.g. software licences) for the CoP will need to be approved by someone. This person is called the _sponsor_ and should be invested in the goals of the CoP and authorised to allocate these resources.

# Starting a new CoP

The process for starting a new CoP is:

1. Briefly outline the subject to be covered (see [Scope](#scope)), a set of [goals](#goals) and a proposed [time](#time) allocation and agree these with the [sponsor](#sponsor).

2. Appoint a [coordinator](#leadership) and agree whether this will be a rotating post.

3. The coordinator will facilitate a kick off along with interested others where the format will be agreed.

4. The scope, goals, format and so on should be recorded somewhere easily accessible to the whole organisation, and esily editable by CoP members, e.g. Confluence.

# Worked example
We include a worked example to illustrate how this thinking can be applied in a specific case. This is an example of a new CoP which is starting with relatively modest goals and time budget.

> #### Subject
> AWS

> #### Sponsor
> Stacy Leblanc
>
> #### Goals
> These will be the initial goals to be reviewed after three months on _DATE_.
>
> * Support individual practitioners and apprentices with specific challenges.
>
> * Educate by broadening and deepening practitioners’ and apprentices’ knowledge of the subject.
>
> * Educate by helping practitioners and apprentices learn about new and emerging tools and techniques.
>
> #### Scope
> This group will focus on AWS native services. AWS marketplace services are out of scope for this group.
>
> #### Coordinator
> This will be a rotating post. Seren Howarth will be coordinator for the first three months.
>
> #### Format and time
> The group will meet monthly for one hour over lunch, where food will be provided (up to £6 per head). The coordinator will help the group determine the format for the next session each time. A time budget of two hours per month (on average) will be used to prepare for sessions when required.
