# Continuous assurance

## Context

* These notes are part of a broader set of [principles](../principles.md)
* See also:
    * [Continuous integration](continuous-integration.md)
    * [Testing](testing.md)

## Principles

* By default, everything should be automated, including team processes and interactions with other teams & systems.
    * e.g. automate interactions with change management process / tools so that a change log is generated by the CI system
    * e.g. interactions with architecture repository process / tools
    * But be pragmatic, and choose where to invest your time. Error-prone, high impact and frequent activities are all high priorities for automation.
* Shift-left with [compliance-as-code](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-tools/).
  * Automated [tests](testing.md).
  * Automated [security](security.md) verification.
  * Automated governance, e.g. using AWS Control Tower, AWS Organisations, AWS Service Catalog, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail.
