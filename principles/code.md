# Code

## Context

* These notes are part of a broader set of [principles](../principles.md)

## Principles

* Everything (including infrastructure) should be created by code
* All code is treated the same (e.g. application code, infrastructure code, test code, etc)
* All code is peer-reviewed and tested
* All code is version controlled
* Code changes should be automatically checked for code quality using tools like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org)
* Code should be automatically scanned for secrets or other senstive data using tools like [AWS Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/)
