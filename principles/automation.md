# Automation

## Context

* These notes are part of a broader set of [principles](../principles.md)
* Useful reading: [Google's view of toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/)
* See also:
    * [Continuous integration](continuous-integration.md)
    * [Test automation](test-automation.md)

## Principles

* By default, everything should be automated, including team processes and interactions with other teams & systems, for example:
    * Interactions with change management process / tools
    * Interactions with architecture repository process / tools
    * Process to rebuild a developer laptop
* But be pragmatic, and choose where to invest your time. Error-prone, high impact and frequent activities are all high priorities for automation.
