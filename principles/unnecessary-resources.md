# Unnecessary resources

## Context

* These notes are part of a broader set of [principles](../principles.md)

## Principles

* Services should scale automatically up and down
* Infrastructure should always be fully utilised (if it isn't, it's generating waste)
* Infrastructure should be purged (ideally automatically) when no longer needed
* Infrastructure must be tagged to identity the service so that unnecessary resources don't go unnoticed
