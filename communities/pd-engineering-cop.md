# Engineering CoP (Community of Practice)

This is part of a broader [quality framework](../README.md) and is one of a set of [communities of practice](../communities-of-practice.md).

There is some overlap with the [Automation Working Group](automation-working-group.md).

## Subject

All aspects of software engineering in NHS Digital Product Development.

## Sponsor

Andy Blundell ([andyblundell](https://github.com/andyblundell))

## Goals

* Identify **good practices and patterns** (as well as those to avoid), and make these easily accessible for all engineers.
  * This includes maintaining the [principles](../principles.md), patterns and practices in this repository.
  * This may also include arranging talks or show and tell sessions provided either internally or by guest speakers.
* Provide clear guidance for engineers on which **tools and technologies** are (and are not) recommended, including:
  * Playing an active role in maintaining the internal technology radar.
  * Being aware of and assessing new and emerging technologies.
* Help individuals and teams **find solutions** to the specific engineering challenges they face.
  * Help must be available when it is needed.
  * CoP members do not need to provide this help directly; they are responsible for creating and environment where help can be easily sought and given by the wider engineering community.
* Maintain references to **learning resources** relevant to each part of the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)

Goals to be reviewed December 2020

## Scope

* Front-end, back-end and platform/infrastructure engineering.
* Technical aspects of delivery and operation of reliable services.
* Architecting and engineering for functional and non-functional requirements and validating they are met (e.g. performance and capacity, security, accessibility). Also see [Automation Working Group](automation-working-group.md).

## Coordinator

* This will be a rotating post on a 3-month basis, requiring a commitment of one day per week

* TBC will be coordinator initially
* The coordinator will run a blog to help publicise the activity of the group
* There will be a deputy coordinator (to cover sessions when the coordinator is away, etc) who will typically take over as coordinator for the following 3 months

## Format

* The group will have an open backlog (TODO: where). The Sponsor and Coordinator will manage the backlog.
* Tickets will be sized and timeboxed to maximum one month to avoid carry-over.
* The group will meet every month to discuss issues, demonstrate solutions, and agree who will work on new tickets.
* To keep these meetings manageable and useful, the aim is to have one representative from each area (this could be a single person, or a rotating role). The aim is for between 10 to 20 people to attend each session.
* The group will also organise and facilitate other meetings, such as training workshops, hack-days, etc, which will be open to a much wider audience.
* The group will maintain a discussion channel (TODO: where) for advice and guidance, as well as group announcements.
